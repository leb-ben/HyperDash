  - Type mismatches
  - Runtime errors
  - Test failures
  - Build failures
  - Unexpected behavior
  - Partial success

**NO EXCEPTIONS. NO SELF-CORRECTION ATTEMPTS.**

### 2. UNCERTAINTY (ABSOLUTE)
- You are unsure of the correct approach
- Multiple valid solutions exist
- You lack context about project conventions
- The task involves unfamiliar patterns

### 3. COMPLEXITY (RECOMMENDED)
